## ℹ️ A Basic Recipe Website Using Only HTML

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A pure HTML website built as part of my earliest lessons in frontend development.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a single-page recipe site built with **HTML5 only**. It displays a simple but structured layout for a classic _Macaroni and Cheese_ recipe using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.

I included navigation links, a featured image with a caption, and organized the ingredients and cooking steps using HTML lists and sections. The project helped me learn how to build and present structured content without any CSS or JavaScript.
